			h1 About VGTrackr
			p
				| VGTrackr is a project by Kate Windheuser-Rodriguez, made as a final project for the Fall 2014 Web Development cohort at RefactorU in lovely, though somewhat crunchy, Boulder, Colorado.  It is a video game cataloguing app written in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, using MongoDB for the database on a Node.js server.
			
			h1 Current Features

			h3 Create a Collection
			p
				| VGTrackr lets you easily browse or search for games for consoles as far back as the Magnavox Odyssey or as new as the PS4 and Xbox One.  A simple click adds the game to your collection.

			h3 Trade Lists
			p
				| From your collection screen, you'll have the ability to add games to a list of games you'd like to trade for different games.   Games added to your trade list will appear on your profile so other users can see them and potentially contact you to set up a trade.  

			h3 Want Lists
			p
				| While browsing games, you'll have the opportunity to add games to your want list.  This will also be displayed on your profile, so users wishing to trade with you will know what you want in return!
			
			h3 What Should You Play?
			p
				| Stuck on what to play?  Try out the WTF Should You Play feature - simply pick a genre and it will give you a random game of that genre from your collection.
			
			h3 Statistics
			p
				| Get at-a-glance statistics about your collection as soon as you log in.  Pricing data is updated daily from <a href="http://www.pricecharting.com">Pricecharting.com</a>, so you'll always have a good estimate of what your collection is worth.

			h1 Upcoming Features

			h3 More Collection Features
			p
				| Upon adding a game to your collection, you'll be able to look it up and rate the game from 1 to 5 stars.  You will also be able to indicate whether your game is complete in box (CIB) or loose(something is missing) and get the appropriate price data, instead of having both prices for each game.  Finally, you'll be able to choose whether each game has been played, completed, or you haven't started it.

			h3 Individual Game Pages
			p
				| Clicking on the name of a game in the browse page or in your collection will take you to a page for that specific game, where you'll have the ability to rate the game, add it to your collection or wantlist, and leave reviews of your opinion of the game.  

			h3 Follow Friends
			p
				| If you have friends that use VGTrackr or just want to keep track of that guy who's got all the best stuff in his tradelist, you can follow other users.  Users you follow will not be required to follow you back.

			h3 Export to PDF or CSV
			p
				| Need a copy of your collection for some reason?  Maybe your insurance agent wants a list of everything so they can insure your collection.  You'll be able to export your collection to a PDF or CSV formatted file, making it easy for you to take your data with you or share it with someone who isn't a user of this site.

			h3 Interact!
			p
				| A messaging system will be introduced, so you can communicate more easily with other users.  Forums may also be introduced, but not probably for awhile.

			h3 Extra Stuff
			p
				| I'm also planning on integrating a feed of video game news articles from various sources, as well as expanding the "WTF Should I Play" machine, which, given a genre, will give you back a random game in your collection to include an option to select just the games in your collection you haven't played.

			h3 Pie in the Sky Possible Features
			p
				| I'm hoping to also integrate Steam functionality, so you could add all the Steam games you own into your collection (though not their prices, because it's not like you can sell them to someone else).  I'd also like people to be able to display their Playstation and Xbox trophies on their profile eventually.
